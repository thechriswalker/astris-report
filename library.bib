	abstract = {Electronic voting schemes are expected to meet the basic security requirements for electronic voting. However, very different opinions about these requirements exist in the e-voting community. This is due to the fact that the security requirements comprise different levels at which they can be met. For example, universal verifiability may, or may not, include verifying eligibility of the voters who participated in the election. This paper provides definitions of different levels of election secrecy and verifiability. We also investigate whether there exists an order for the different levels and provide adversary models. The resulting compilation is useful since it may not be necessary, or even possible, to achieve the maximum level for all the security requirements in parallel. Thus, appropriate levels of the requirements can be selected for different types of elections, e.g. parliamentary elections vs. elections in associations.},

	abstract = {In organizing elections, a difficult problem is to achieve trust of all voters in the tallying process. Practical elections often lead to recounting of the submitted votes and raise questions about the validity of many submitted votes. There are even situations, when the opposition raises concerns about the validity of the whole election process due to insufficient transparency in the verification of the votes and in tallying. To solve this problem, the present paper proposes a new voting protocol based on the blockchain technology. There are several main advantages of the protocol. It does not rely on a trusted tallying authority. All votes are submitted with complete proofs of validity and are available for public access in an encrypted form. We propose a new encryption mechanism to guarantee that nobody can decrypt the votes, but everyone can verify the validity of the votes as well as the outcome of the tallying process by using the homomorphic property of the encryption. This makes the results of the election publicly verifiable. Our protocol enables all voters to store, verify, and tally all submitted votes which are added to a blockchain database. They allow every voter to rank each candidate by assigning different scores to them, rather than voting for only one candidate. Each vote is encrypted using a new encryption mechanism before submission. For each encrypted score in the vote, proofs are generated and stored. Everyone can use these proofs to verify the correctness and the eligibility of each submission without decrypting the content of the vote. This ensures the validity of the submitted votes in the counting process and at the same time maintains confidentiality. The security and performance analyses included in this paper demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed protocol for implementation in real elections.},

These schemes aim to allow voters to verify that their votes have contributed in the way they intended to the tally and in addition allow anyone to verify that the tally has been generated correctly. These goals must be achieved while maintaining voter privacy and providing receipt-freeness. However, most of these end-to-end voting schemes are only designed to handle a single election method and the voter interface varies greatly between different schemes. In this paper, we introduce a scheme which handles many of the popular election methods that are currently used around the world. Our scheme not only ensures privacy, receipt-freeness and end-to-end verifiability, but also keeps the voter interface simple and consistent between various election methods},

	abstract = {Most electronic voting systems today satisfy the basic requirements of privacy, unreusability, eligibility and fairness in a natural and rather straightforward way. However, receipt-freeness, incoercibility and universal verifiability are much harder to implement and in many cases they require a large amount of computation and communication overhead. In this work, we propose a blockchain-based voting system which achieves all the properties expected from secure elections without requiring too much from the voter. Coercion resistance and receipt-freeness are ensured by means of a randomizer token -- a tamper-resistance source of randomness which acts as a black box in constructing the ballot for the user. Universal verifiability is ensured by the append-only structure of the blockchain, thus minimizing the trust placed in election authorities. Additionally, the system has linear overhead when tallying the votes, hence it is scalable and practical for large scale elections.},

Numerous electronic systems have been proposed and implemented but some suspicion has been raised regarding the integrity of elections due to detected security vulnerabilities within these systems. Electronic voting, to be successful, requires a more transparent and secure approach, than is offered by current protocols. The approach presented in this paper involves a protocol developed on blockchain technology. The underlying technology used in the voting system is a payment scheme, which offers anonymity of transactions, a trait not seen in blockchain protocols to date. The proposed protocol offers anonymity of voter transactions, while keeping the transactions private, and the election transparent and secure. The underlying payment protocol has not been modified in any way, the voting protocol merely offers an alternative use case.},

However, in such electronic voting systems, the public bulletin board that is hosted by the third party for publishing and auditing the voting results should be trusted by all participants. Recently a number of blockchain-based solutions have been proposed to address this issue. However, these systems are impractical to use due to the limitations on the voter and candidate numbers supported, and their security framework, which highly depends on the underlying blockchain protocol and suffers from potential attacks (e.g., force-abstention attacks). To deal with two aforementioned issues, we propose a practical platform-independent secure and verifiable voting system that can be deployed on any blockchain that supports an execution of a smart contract. Verifiability is inherently provided by the underlying blockchain platform, whereas cryptographic techniques like Paillier encryption, proof-of-knowledge, and linkable ring signature are employed to provide a framework for system security and user-privacy that are independent from the security and privacy features of the blockchain platform. We analyse the correctness and coercion-resistance of our proposed voting system. We employ Hyperledger Fabric to deploy our voting system and analyse the performance of our deployed scheme numerically.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a cryptographic technique for an authenticated, end-to-end verifiable and secret ballot election. Voters should receive assurance that their vote is cast as intended, recorded as cast and tallied as recorded. The election system as a whole should ensure that voter coercion is unlikely, even when voters are willing to be influenced. Currently, almost all verifiable e-voting systems require trusted authorities to perform the tallying process. An exception is the DRE-i and DRE-ip system. The DRE-ip system removes the requirement of tallying authorities by encrypting ballot in such a way that the election tally can be publicly verified without decrypting cast ballots. However, the DRE-ip system necessitates a secure bulletin board (BB) for storing the encrypted ballot as without it the integrity of the system may be lost and the result can be compromised without detection during the audit phase. In this paper, we have modified the DRE-ip system so that if any recorded ballot is tampered by an adversary before the tallying phase, it will be detected during the tallying phase. In addition, we have described a method using zero knowledge based public blockchain to store these ballots so that it remains tamper proof. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first end-to-end verifiable Direct-recording electronic (DRE) based e-voting system using blockchain. In our case, we assume that the bulletin board is insecure and an adversary has read and write access to the bulletin board. We have also added a secure biometric with government provided identity card based authentication mechanism for voter authentication. The proposed system is able to encrypt ballot in such a way that the election tally can be publicly verified without decrypting cast ballots maintaining end-to-end verifiability and without requiring the secure bulletin board.},

	abstract = {McCorry et al. (Financial Cryptography 2017) presented the first implementation of a decentralized self-tallying voting protocol on Ethereum. However, their implementation did not scale beyond 40 voters since all the computations were performed on the smart contract. In this paper, we tackle this problem by delegating the bulk computations to an off-chain untrusted administrator in a verifiable manner. Specifically, the administrator tallies the votes off-chain and publishes a Merkle tree that encodes the tallying computation trace. Then, the administrator submits the Merkle tree root and the tally result to the smart contract. Subsequently, the smart contract transits to an intermediate phase where at least a single honest voter can contend the administrator's claimed result if it was not computed correctly. Then, in the worst case, the smart contract verifies the dispute at the cost of an elliptic curve point addition and scalar multiplication, and two Merkle proofs of membership which are logarithmic in the number of voters. This allows our protocol to achieve higher scalability without sacrificing the public verifiability or voters' privacy. To assess our protocol, we implemented an open-source prototype on Ethereum and carried out multiple experiments for different numbers of voters. The results of our implementation confirm the scalability and efficiency of our proposed solution which does not exceed the current block gas limit for any practical number of voters.},

	url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1270},
	abstract = {In the pairing-based zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARK), there often exists a requirement for the proof system to be combined with encryption. As a typical example, a blockchain-based voting system requires the vote to be confidential (using encryption), while verifying voting validity (using zk-SNARKs). In these combined applications, a typical solution is to extend the zk-SNARK circuit to include the encryption code. However, complex cryptographic operations in the encryption algorithm increase the circuit size, which leads to impractically large proving time and CRS size.



In this paper, we propose SNARK-friendly, Additively-homomorphic, and Verifiable Encryption and decryption with Rerandomization or SAVER, which is a novel approach to detach the encryption from the SNARK circuit. The encryption in SAVER holds many useful properties. It is SNARK-friendly: the encryption is conjoined with an existing pairing-based SNARK, in a way that the encryptor can prove pre-defined properties while encrypting the message apart from the SNARK. It is additively-homomorphic: the ciphertext holds a homomorphic property from the ElGamal-based encryption. It is a verifiable encryption: one can verify arbitrary properties of encrypted messages by connecting with the SNARK system. It provides a verifiable decryption: anyone without the secret can still verify that the decrypted message is indeed from the given ciphertext. It provides rerandomization: the proof and the ciphertext can be rerandomized as independent objects so that even the encryptor (or prover) herself cannot identify the origin.

For the representative application, we also propose a Vote-SAVER based on SAVER, which is a novel voting system where voter's secret key lies only with the voter himself. The Vote-SAVER satisfies receipt-freeness (which implies ballot privacy), individual verifiability (which implies non-repudiation), vote verifiability, tally uniqueness, and voter anonymity. The experimental results show that our SAVER with respect to the Vote-SAVER relation yields 0.7s for zk-SNARK proving time and 10ms for encryption, with the CRS size of 16MB.},

	abstract = {The importance of trust in working relationships is widely acknowledged among organizational researchers and practitioners. Unfortunately, trust is defined and measured differently across studies, making it difficult to integrate and compare research findings. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to clarify the nature of trust as it exists across research and organizational settings. First, trust was conceptualized in terms of 10 defining characteristics based on a convergence and reconciliation of inconsistencies among existing definitions. These 10 characteristics of trust were incorporated into a single definition of trust to offer a more comprehensive description of the construct. Second, the Functional Trust Scale (FTS) was constructed to operationalize trust in terms of its 10 defining characteristics to provide a more complete and representative measure of trust that can be applied to a variety of situations. Third, empirical and statistical methods were employed to assess the structure and psychometric properties of the FTS. The results of this study provide initial evidence supporting the FTS and its underlying concept of trust. First, the hypothesized FTS measurement model resulted as the best fitting model among alternate models within two samples. Second, the FTS resulted in conceptual similarity across two applications, suggesting that it is applicable across multiple situations. Third, the internal consistency of the FTS and its sub-scales suggest that it is a reliable measure. Finally, the results provide initial support for the content, face, convergent, and divergent validity of the FTS.},

These properties are expressed using observational equivalence and we show in accordance with intuition that coercion-resistance implies receipt-freeness which implies vote-privacy. Concerning verifiability, we distinguish three aspects of verifiability, which we call individual verifiability, universal verifiability, and eligibility verifiability.},

When the encrypted data is derived from homomorphic evaluations in the context of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), verifiable decryption will be very useful in cloud computing or cryptographic protocols, e.g., secure medical computation, cryptographically verifiable election, etc. In this paper, we consider the problem of proving the correct decryption of an FHE ciphertext. Namely, we are interested in zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge of triples (𝑚,𝐬,𝐜)(m,s,c)(m, {\textbackslash}mathbf \{s\}, {\textbackslash}mathbf \{c\}) such that the message m is the correct decryption of a ciphertext 𝐜c{\textbackslash}mathbf \{c\} for a secret key 𝐬s{\textbackslash}mathbf \{s\}. While analogous statements admit efficient zero-knowledge proof protocols in the discrete logarithm setting, they have never been addressed in FHE so far. We provide such verifiable decryption for Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) scheme, since this scheme was recognized as one of the most efficient leveled FHE schemes. Our solution is nearly “one shot”, in the sense that a single instance of the proof already has negligible soundness error, yielding compact proofs even for individual ciphertexts. Furthermore, to illustrate the applicability of verifiable decryption, we also give two example instantiations.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

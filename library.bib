  abstract = {Voting with cryptographic auditing, sometimes called open-audit voting, has remained, for the most part, a theoretical endeavor. In spite of dozens of fascinating protocols and recent ground-breaking advances in the field, there exist only a handful of specialized implementations that few people have experienced directly. As a result, the benefits of cryptographically audited elections have remained elusive. We present Helios, the first web-based, open-audit voting system. Helios is publicly accessible today: anyone can create and run an election, and any willing observer can audit the entire process. Helios is ideal for on-line software communities, local clubs, student government, and other environments where trustworthy, secret-ballot elections are required but coercion is not a serious concern. With Helios, we hope to expose many to the power of open-audit elections.},

  abstract = {As the most successful cryptocurrency to date, Bitcoin constitutes a target of choice for attackers. While many attack vectors have already been uncovered, one important vector has been left out though: attacking the currency via the Internet routing infrastructure itself. Indeed, by manipulating routing advertisements (BGP hijacks) or by naturally intercepting traffic, Autonomous Systems (ASes) can intercept and manipulate a large fraction of Bitcoin traffic. This paper presents the first taxonomy of routing attacks and their impact on Bitcoin, considering both small-scale attacks, targeting individual nodes, and large-scale attacks, targeting the network as a whole. While challenging, we show that two key properties make routing attacks practical: (i) the efficiency of routing manipulation; and (ii) the significant centralization of Bitcoin in terms of mining and routing. Specifically, we find that any network attacker can hijack few ({$<$};100) BGP prefixes to isolate 50\% of the mining power-even when considering that mining pools are heavily multi-homed. We also show that on-path network attackers can considerably slow down block propagation by interfering with few key Bitcoin messages. We demonstrate the feasibility of each attack against the deployed Bitcoin software. We also quantify their effectiveness on the current Bitcoin topology using data collected from a Bitcoin supernode combined with BGP routing data. The potential damage to Bitcoin is worrying. By isolating parts of the network or delaying block propagation, attackers can cause a significant amount of mining power to be wasted, leading to revenue losses and enabling a wide range of exploits such as double spending. To prevent such effects in practice, we provide both short and long-term countermeasures, some of which can be deployed immediately.},

Analogously, a randomizable signature can be transformed into a new signature on the same message. We combine randomizable encryption and signatures to a new primitive as follows: given a signature on a ciphertext, anyone, knowing neither the signing key nor the encrypted message, can randomize the ciphertext and adapt the signature to the fresh encryption, thus maintaining public verifiability. Moreover, given the decryption key and a signature on a ciphertext, one can compute (``extract'') a signature on the encrypted plaintext. As adapting a signature to a randomized encryption contradicts the standard notion of unforgeability, we introduce a weaker notion stating that no adversary can, after querying signatures on ciphertexts of its choice, output a signature on an encryption of a new message. This is reasonable since, due to extractability, a signature on an encrypted message can be interpreted as an encrypted signature on the message.},

Furthermore, the use of lattice-based primitives greatly simplifies the proofs of correctness, privacy and verifiability, as no zero-knowledge proof are needed to prove the validity of individual ballots or the correctness of the final election result. The security of our scheme is based on classical SIS/LWE assumptions, which are asymptotically as hard as worstcase lattice problems and relies on the random oracle heuristic. We also propose a new procedure to distribute the decryption task, where each trustee provides an independent proof of correct decryption in the form of a publicly verifiable ciphertext trapdoor. In particular, our protocol requires only two trustees, unlike classical proposals using threshold decryption via Shamir's secret sharing.},

We particularly focus on privacy and verifiability properties. Our definitions allow us to specify and easily change which authorities are supposed to be trustworthy and are compatible with a large class of electronic voting schemes, including those based on blind signatures, homomorphic encryptions, and mixnets.\textbackslash par We distinguish three notions of privacy: vote-privacy, receipt-freeness and coercion-resistance. These properties are expressed using observational equivalence and we show in accordance with intuition that coercion-resistance implies receipt-freeness which implies vote-privacy. Concerning verifiability, we distinguish three aspects of verifiability, which we call individual verifiability, universal verifiability, and eligibility verifiability.},

In this work, we propose a blockchain-based voting system which achieves all the properties expected from secure elections without requiring too much from the voter. Coercion resistance and receipt-freeness are ensured by means of a randomizer token -- a tamper-resistance source of randomness which acts as a black box in constructing the ballot for the user. Universal verifiability is ensured by the append-only structure of the blockchain, thus minimizing the trust placed in election authorities. Additionally, the system has linear overhead when tallying the votes, hence it is scalable and practical for large scale elections.},

Conventional wisdom asserts that the mining protocol is incentive-compatible and secure against colluding minority groups, that is, it incentivizes miners to follow the protocol as prescribed.We show that the Bitcoin mining protocol is not incentive-compatible. We present an attack with which colluding miners obtain a revenue larger than their fair share. This attack can have significant consequences for Bitcoin: Rational miners will prefer to join the selfish miners, and the colluding group will increase in size until it becomes a majority. At this point, the Bitcoin system ceases to be a decentralized currency.Unless certain assumptions are made, selfish mining may be feasible for any group size of colluding miners. We propose a practical modification to the Bitcoin protocol that protects Bitcoin in the general case. It prohibits selfish mining by pools that command less than 1/41/41/4 of the resources. This threshold is lower than the wrongly assumed 1/21/21/2 bound, but better than the current reality where a group of any size can compromise the system.},

We take a detailed look at bitcoin's peer-to-peer network, and quantify the resources involved in our attack via probabilistic analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, measurements and experiments with live bitcoin nodes. Finally, we present countermeasures, inspired by botnet architectures, that are designed to raise the bar for eclipse attacks while preserving the openness and decentralization of bitcoin's current network architecture.},

In particular, we allow the adversary to demand of coerced voters that they vote in a particular manner, abstain from voting, or even disclose their secret keys. We define a scheme to be \_coercion-resistant\_ if it is infeasible for the adversary to determine whether a coerced voter complies with the demands. A first contribution of this paper is to describe and characterize a new and strengthened adversary for coercion in elections. (In doing so, we additionally present what we believe to be the first formal security definitions for electronic elections of \_any\_ type.) A second contribution is to demonstrate a protocol that is secure against this adversary. While it is clear that a strengthening of attack models is of theoretical relevance, it is important to note that our results lie close to practicality. This is true both in that we model real-life threats (such as vote-buying and vote-cancelling), and in that our proposed protocol combines a fair degree of efficiency with an unusual lack of structural complexity. Furthermore, while previous schemes have required use of an untappable channel, ours only carries the much more practical requirement of an anonymous channel.},

  abstract = {Bitcoin is a decentralized payment system that relies on Proof-of-Work (PoW) to verify payments. Nowadays, Bitcoin is increasingly used in a number of fast payment scenarios, where the time between the exchange of currency and goods is short (in the order of few seconds). While the Bitcoin payment verification scheme is designed to prevent double-spending, our results show that the system requires tens of minutes to verify a transaction and is therefore inappropriate for fast payments. An example of this use of Bitcoin was recently reported in the media: Bitcoins were used as a form of \textbackslash emph\{fast\} payment in a local fast-food restaurant. Until now, the security of fast Bitcoin payments has not been studied. In this paper, we analyze the security of using Bitcoin for fast payments. We show that, unless appropriate detection techniques are integrated in the current Bitcoin implementation, double-spending attacks on fast payments succeed with overwhelming probability and can be mounted at low cost. We further show that the measures recommended by Bitcoin developers for the use of Bitcoin in fast payments are not always effective in detecting double-spending; we show that if those recommendations are integrated in future Bitcoin implementations, double-spending attacks on Bitcoin will still be possible. Finally, we propose and implement a modification to the existing Bitcoin implementation that ensures the detection of double-spending attacks against fast payments.},

  abstract = {In conventional PKI, CAs are assumed to be fully trusted. However, in practice, CAs' absolute responsibility for providing trustworthiness caused major security and privacy issues. To prevent such issues, Google introduced the concept of Certificate Transparency (CT) in 2013. Later, several new PKI models are proposed to reduce the level of trust to the CAs. However, all of these proposals are still vulnerable to split-world attacks if the adversary is capable of showing different views of the log to the targeted victims. In this paper, we propose a new PKI architecture with certificate transparency based on blockchain, what we called CertLedger, to eliminate the split-world attacks and to provide certificate/revocation transparency. All TLS certificates' validation, storage, and entire revocation process is conducted in CertLedger as well as Trusted CA certificate management. During a TLS connection, TLS clients get an efficient proof of existence of the certificate directly from its domain owners. Hence, privacy is now perfectly preserved by eliminating the traceability issue via OCSP servers. It also provides a unique, efficient, and trustworthy certificate validation process eliminating the conventional inadequate and incompatible certificate validation processes implemented by different software vendors. TLS clients in CertLedger also do not require to make certificate validation and store the trusted CA certificates anymore. We analyze the security and performance of CertLedger and provide a comparison with the previous proposals. Finally, we implement its protoype on Ethereum to demonstrate experimental results. The results show that the performance of the TLS handshake and certificate validation through CertLedger is significantly improved compared to the current TLS protocol.},

  abstract = {In the pairing-based zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARK), there often exists a requirement for the proof system to be combined with encryption. As a typical example, a blockchain-based voting system requires the vote to be confidential (using encryption), while verifying voting validity (using zk-SNARKs). In these combined applications, a typical solution is to extend the zk-SNARK circuit to include the encryption code. However, complex cryptographic operations in the encryption algorithm increase the circuit size, which leads to impractically large proving time and CRS size. In this paper, we propose SNARK-friendly, Additively-homomorphic, and Verifiable Encryption and decryption with Rerandomization or SAVER, which is a novel approach to detach the encryption from the SNARK circuit. The encryption in SAVER holds many useful properties. It is SNARK-friendly: the encryption is conjoined with an existing pairing-based SNARK, in a way that the encryptor can prove pre-defined properties while encrypting the message apart from the SNARK. It is additively-homomorphic: the ciphertext holds a homomorphic property from the ElGamal-based encryption. It is a verifiable encryption: one can verify arbitrary properties of encrypted messages by connecting with the SNARK system. It provides a verifiable decryption: anyone without the secret can still verify that the decrypted message is indeed from the given ciphertext. It provides rerandomization: the proof and the ciphertext can be rerandomized as independent objects so that even the encryptor (or prover) herself cannot identify the origin. For the representative application, we also propose a Vote-SAVER based on SAVER, which is a novel voting system where voter's secret key lies only with the voter himself. The Vote-SAVER satisfies receipt-freeness (which implies ballot privacy), individual verifiability (which implies non-repudiation), vote verifiability, tally uniqueness, and voter anonymity. The experimental results show that our SAVER with respect to the Vote-SAVER relation yields 0.7s for zk-SNARK proving time and 10ms for encryption, with the CRS size of 16MB.},

When the encrypted data is derived from homomorphic evaluations in the context of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), verifiable decryption will be very useful in cloud computing or cryptographic protocols, e.g., secure medical computation, cryptographically verifiable election, etc. In this paper, we consider the problem of proving the correct decryption of an FHE ciphertext. Namely, we are interested in zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge of triples ({$\mathsl{m}$},{$\mathbf{s}$},{$\mathbf{c}$})(m,s,c)(m, \textbackslash mathbf \{s\}, \textbackslash mathbf \{c\}) such that the message m is the correct decryption of a ciphertext {$\mathbf{c}$}c\textbackslash mathbf \{c\} for a secret key {$\mathbf{s}$}s\textbackslash mathbf \{s\}. While analogous statements admit efficient zero-knowledge proof protocols in the discrete logarithm setting, they have never been addressed in FHE so far. We provide such verifiable decryption for Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) scheme, since this scheme was recognized as one of the most efficient leveled FHE schemes. Our solution is nearly ``one shot'', in the sense that a single instance of the proof already has negligible soundness error, yielding compact proofs even for individual ciphertexts. Furthermore, to illustrate the applicability of verifiable decryption, we also give two example instantiations.},

The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

  author = {Panja, Somnath and Roy, Bimal Kumar},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {In this paper, we present a cryptographic technique for an authenticated, end-to-end verifiable and secret ballot election. Voters should receive assurance that their vote is cast as intended, recorded as cast and tallied as recorded. The election system as a whole should ensure that voter coercion is unlikely, even when voters are willing to be influenced. Currently, almost all verifiable e-voting systems require trusted authorities to perform the tallying process. An exception is the DRE-i and DRE-ip system. The DRE-ip system removes the requirement of tallying authorities by encrypting ballot in such a way that the election tally can be publicly verified without decrypting cast ballots. However, the DRE-ip system necessitates a secure bulletin board (BB) for storing the encrypted ballot as without it the integrity of the system may be lost and the result can be compromised without detection during the audit phase. In this paper, we have modified the DRE-ip system so that if any recorded ballot is tampered by an adversary before the tallying phase, it will be detected during the tallying phase. In addition, we have described a method using zero knowledge based public blockchain to store these ballots so that it remains tamper proof. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first end-to-end verifiable Direct-recording electronic (DRE) based e-voting system using blockchain. In our case, we assume that the bulletin board is insecure and an adversary has read and write access to the bulletin board. We have also added a secure biometric with government provided identity card based authentication mechanism for voter authentication. The proposed system is able to encrypt ballot in such a way that the election tally can be publicly verified without decrypting cast ballots maintaining end-to-end verifiability and without requiring the secure bulletin board.},

  abstract = {The importance of trust in working relationships is widely acknowledged among organizational researchers and practitioners. Unfortunately, trust is defined and measured differently across studies, making it difficult to integrate and compare research findings. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to clarify the nature of trust as it exists across research and organizational settings. First, trust was conceptualized in terms of 10 defining characteristics based on a convergence and reconciliation of inconsistencies among existing definitions. These 10 characteristics of trust were incorporated into a single definition of trust to offer a more comprehensive description of the construct. Second, the Functional Trust Scale (FTS) was constructed to operationalize trust in terms of its 10 defining characteristics to provide a more complete and representative measure of trust that can be applied to a variety of situations. Third, empirical and statistical methods were employed to assess the structure and psychometric properties of the FTS. The results of this study provide initial evidence supporting the FTS and its underlying concept of trust. First, the hypothesized FTS measurement model resulted as the best fitting model among alternate models within two samples. Second, the FTS resulted in conceptual similarity across two applications, suggesting that it is applicable across multiple situations. Third, the internal consistency of the FTS and its sub-scales suggest that it is a reliable measure. Finally, the results provide initial support for the content, face, convergent, and divergent validity of the FTS.},

Strong nodes can, however, gain higher payoffs by withholding blocks they create and selectively postponing their publication. The existence of such selfish mining attacks was first reported by Eyal and Sirer, who have demonstrated a specific deviation from the standard protocol (a strategy that we name SM1).In this paper we investigate the profit threshold \textendash{} the minimal fraction of resources required for a profitable attack. Our analysis provides a bound under which the system can be considered secure against such attacks. Our techniques can be adapted to protocol modifications to assess their susceptibility to selfish mining, by computing the optimal attack under different variants. We find that the profit threshold is strictly lower than the one induced by the SM1 scheme. The policies given by our algorithm dominate SM1 by better regulating attack-withdrawals. We further evaluate the impact of some previously suggested countermeasures, and show that they are less effective than previously conjectured.We then gain insight into selfish mining in the presence of communication delays, and show that, under a model that accounts for delays, the profit threshold vanishes, and even small attackers have incentive to occasionally deviate from the protocol. We conclude with observations regarding the combined power of selfish mining and double spending attacks.},

  abstract = {McCorry et al. (Financial Cryptography 2017) presented the first implementation of a decentralized self-tallying voting protocol on Ethereum. However, their implementation did not scale beyond 40 voters since all the computations were performed on the smart contract. In this paper, we tackle this problem by delegating the bulk computations to an off-chain untrusted administrator in a verifiable manner. Specifically, the administrator tallies the votes off-chain and publishes a Merkle tree that encodes the tallying computation trace. Then, the administrator submits the Merkle tree root and the tally result to the smart contract. Subsequently, the smart contract transits to an intermediate phase where at least a single honest voter can contend the administrator's claimed result if it was not computed correctly. Then, in the worst case, the smart contract verifies the dispute at the cost of an elliptic curve point addition and scalar multiplication, and two Merkle proofs of membership which are logarithmic in the number of voters. This allows our protocol to achieve higher scalability without sacrificing the public verifiability or voters' privacy. To assess our protocol, we implemented an open-source prototype on Ethereum and carried out multiple experiments for different numbers of voters. The results of our implementation confirm the scalability and efficiency of our proposed solution which does not exceed the current block gas limit for any practical number of voters.},

This paper gives Las Vegas algorithms for finding discrete logarithms and factoring integers on a quantum computer that take a number of steps which is polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. These two problems are generally considered hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems.

The proposed protocol offers anonymity of voter transactions, while keeping the transactions private, and the election transparent and secure.

However, before employing electronic voting systems in regular elections, problems such as coercion and vote selling have to be solved. Juels, Catalano and Jakobsson introduced a strong security requirement that deals with theses concerns. Coercion resistance improves on the former security notion of receipt freeness by taking additional real-life threats into account. In this paper, we present a coercion-resistant election scheme with a linear work factor. The scheme is based on the previous proposal of Juels et al., which exhibited a quadratic work factor, and employs Smith's idea to achieve a speedup to linear work. It, however, overcomes the drawbacks of these preceding solutions. We also present an evaluation of the scheme and identify the drawbacks and the real world aspects related to the scheme},

We provide a structured methodology to determine the appropriate technical solution to solve a particular application problem. Given our methodology, we analyze in depth three use cases --- Supply Chain Management, Interbank and International Payments, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and conclude the article with an outlook for further opportunities.},

  abstract = {Abstract. A number of end-to-end verifiable voting schemes have been introduced recently. These schemes aim to allow voters to verify that their votes have contributed in the way they intended to the tally and in addition allow anyone to verify that the tally has been generated correctly. These goals must be achieved while maintaining voter privacy and providing receipt-freeness. However, most of these end-to-end voting schemes are only designed to handle a single election method and the voter interface varies greatly between different schemes. In this paper, we introduce a scheme which handles many of the popular election methods that are currently used around the world. Our scheme not only ensures privacy, receipt-freeness and end-to-end verifiability, but also keeps the voter interface simple and consistent between various election methods},

  abstract = {Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the cornerstone technology that facilitates secure information exchange over the Internet. However, PKI is exposed to risks due to potential failures of Certificate Authorities (CAs) that may be used to issue unauthorized certificates for end-users. Many recent breaches show that if a CA is compromised, the security of the corresponding end-users will be in risk. As an emerging solution, Blockchain technology potentially resolves the problems of traditional PKI systems - in particular, elimination of single point-of-failure and rapid reaction to CAs shortcomings. Blockchain has the ability to store and manage digital certificates within a public and immutable ledger, resulting in a fully traceable history log. In this paper we designed and developed a blockchain-based PKI management framework for issuing, validating and revoking X.509 certificates. Evaluation and experimental results confirm that the proposed framework provides more reliable and robust PKI systems with modest maintenance costs.},

  abstract = {In organizing elections, a difficult problem is to achieve trust of all voters in the tallying process. Practical elections often lead to recounting of the submitted votes and raise questions about the validity of many submitted votes. There are even situations, when the opposition raises concerns about the validity of the whole election process due to insufficient transparency in the verification of the votes and in tallying. To solve this problem, the present paper proposes a new voting protocol based on the blockchain technology. There are several main advantages of the protocol. It does not rely on a trusted tallying authority. All votes are submitted with complete proofs of validity and are available for public access in an encrypted form. We propose a new encryption mechanism to guarantee that nobody can decrypt the votes, but everyone can verify the validity of the votes as well as the outcome of the tallying process by using the homomorphic property of the encryption. This makes the results of the election publicly verifiable. Our protocol enables all voters to store, verify, and tally all submitted votes which are added to a blockchain database. They allow every voter to rank each candidate by assigning different scores to them, rather than voting for only one candidate. Each vote is encrypted using a new encryption mechanism before submission. For each encrypted score in the vote, proofs are generated and stored. Everyone can use these proofs to verify the correctness and the eligibility of each submission without decrypting the content of the vote. This ensures the validity of the submitted votes in the counting process and at the same time maintains confidentiality. The security and performance analyses included in this paper demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed protocol for implementation in real elections.},

However, if an attacker has access to calculation hash power greater than half of the total hash power, this attacker can create a double-spending attack or 51\% attack. The cost of creating a 51\% attack is surprisingly low if hash power is abundantly available. That posts a great threat to lots of PoW blockchains. We propose a technique to combine history weighted information of miners with the total calculation difficulty to alleviate the 51\% attack problem. Analysis indicates that with the new technique, the cost of a traditional attack is increased by two orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {Cryptographic techniques are employed to ensure the security of voting systems in order to increase its wide adoption. However, in such electronic voting systems, the public bulletin board that is hosted by the third party for publishing and auditing the voting results should be trusted by all participants. Recently a number of blockchain-based solutions have been proposed to address this issue. However, these systems are impractical to use due to the limitations on the voter and candidate numbers supported, and their security framework, which highly depends on the underlying blockchain protocol and suffers from potential attacks (e.g., force-abstention attacks). To deal with two aforementioned issues, we propose a practical platform-independent secure and verifiable voting system that can be deployed on any blockchain that supports an execution of a smart contract. Verifiability is inherently provided by the underlying blockchain platform, whereas cryptographic techniques like Paillier encryption, proof-of-knowledge, and linkable ring signature are employed to provide a framework for system security and user-privacy that are independent from the security and privacy features of the blockchain platform. We analyse the correctness and coercion-resistance of our proposed voting system. We employ Hyperledger Fabric to deploy our voting system and analyse the performance of our deployed scheme numerically.},

  abstract = {Bitcoin is the first decentralized crypto-currency that is currently by far the most popular one in use. The bitcoin transaction syntax is expressive enough to setup digital contracts whose fund transfer can be enforced automatically.In this paper, we design protocols for the bitcoin voting problem, in which there are n voters, each of which wishes to fund exactly one of two candidates A and B. The winning candidate is determined by majority voting, while the privacy of individual vote is preserved. Moreover, the decision is irrevocable in the sense that once the outcome is revealed, the winning candidate is guaranteed to have the funding from all n voters. As in previous works, each voter is incentivized to follow the protocol by being required to put a deposit in the system, which will be used as compensation if he deviates from the protocol. Our solution is similar to previous protocols used for lottery, but needs an additional phase to distribute secret random numbers via zero-knowledge-proofs. Moreover, we have resolved a security issue in previous protocols that could prevent compensation from being paid.},

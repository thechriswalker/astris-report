\label{ch:astris}

\section{Objectives and Non-Objectives of the Protocol}
\label{ch:astris:aims}

Which aspects I intend to improve, and what assumptions/axioms I will make.

\section{Protocol Overview}
\label{ch:astris:overview}

Brief outline of the basics of the protocol, with the phases mentioned.

\section{Protocol Detail}
\label{ch:astris:detail}

How the phases fit to together and exactly what data is gathered at each step

\subsection{Setup Phase}
\label{ch:astris:detail:setup}

What data is recorded onto the chain upfront?

\subsection{Voting Phase}
\label{ch:astris:detail:vote}

How are voters authenticated, how are their votes secured, how they are verified.
Are multiple votes allowed? last vote wins?

\subsection{Tallying Phase}
\label{ch:astris:detail:tally}

What is needed to be done to tally the votes, how does this not break the confidentiality of the voter?

\subsection{Verification Phase}
\label{ch:astris:detail:verify}

How can an observer who has been part of the chain verify the result? Can an outsider that only see the final chain be convinced it is valid?

\section{Analysis of the Proposed Protocol}
\label{ch:analysis:analysis}

\todo{Does the protocol meet the security properties I wanted it to?
    Yes, but as for trust, it is reduced but is it minimal?}


\section{Comparison to Existing Protocols}
\label{ch:analysis:comparison}

\todo{
    Does it tick more boxes? Does it make different assumptions? Is there less trust required?

    I would say it ticks a few more boxes, but the assumptions are different.
}

\section{Implementation Success and Analysis}
\label{ch:analysis:impl}

\todo{
    Did the implementation work? Did it achieve it's objectives? \\
    Does is have any obvious flaws? Where did I take shortcuts? \\
    What assumptions does it make? \\

    The implementation proved that such a system can be built, however the problems of remote voting and satan's computer put the trust back into the hands of the authorities we were hoping not to have to trust.

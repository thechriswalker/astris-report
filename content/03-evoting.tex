\section{Specific Requirements for E-Voting}
\label{ch:ev:specific}

\todo{
    Why e-voting is different.

    It is remote by definition, although voting booths are not precluded, can we trust the computer system at the booth? (can we trust our own device - programming satan's computer and all that...)

    Remote voting makes a difference. No coercion-resistence is possible as a coercer can stand over you with a gun to your head throughout the entire process and the authorities will not know the difference.

    As coercion resistance is not possible, what other properties become more relevant\dots

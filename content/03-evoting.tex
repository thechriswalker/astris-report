\section{Specific Requirements for E-Voting}

\todo{
    Why e-voting is different.

    It is remote by definition, although voting booths are not precluded, can we trust the computer system at the booth? (can we trust our own device - programming satan's computer and all that...)

    Remote voting makes a difference. No coercion-resistence is possible as a coercer can stand over you with a gun to your head throughout the entire process and the authorities will not know the difference.

    blockchain crypto \cite{yuPlatformindependentSecureBlockchainBased2018}

    cryptocurrency based: running atop a generic cryptocurrency system such as bitcoin \cite{zhaoHowVotePrivately2016} or zcash \cite{tarasovInternetVotingUsing2017}

    smart contract based: using smart contracts to enfore their rules. This implies running on an existing blockchain w th smart contract support, like ethereum or hyperledger fabric. \cite{mccorrySmartContractBoardroom2017} (limitations.)

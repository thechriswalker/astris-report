\section*{Acknowledgments}

This project was written in 2020/2021 which was when the COVID-19 pandemic occured. I have two children and
during this period my families patience was tested to a degree not before seen.

This project would not have been possible without the support of my wife, Rosie, who was a rock and shouldered
burden after burden as we both attempted to hold down full-time jobs, home-school our children and deal with
me stressing out about trying to find time to write this.

Additional thanks to my supervisor, Kostas, who has kept me on track and guided me on how to piece this together.

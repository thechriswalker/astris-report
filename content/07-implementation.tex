\section{Notes on Implementation}
\label{ch:sw:notes}

\todo{
    What I learned during the implementation phase. What was challenging. \\
    What was easy. How well it went. etc ... \\


    Mainly that there is an enormous amount of work involved, the blockchain and crypto are a small part of the overall project, the finer grained detail of the peer-to-peer gossiping and managing the chain where much more difficult.

    Also it became clear during the implementation and specification that blockchain technology only adds so much and the unavoidable problems we have to hand-wave as axioms means that such a system cannot exist practically, despite the theory being sound.
